OpenStack library for privilege separation

This library helps applications perform actions which require more or
less privileges than they were started with in a safe, easy to code
and easy to use manner. For more information on why this is generally
a good idea please read over the `principle of least privilege`_ and
the `specification`_ which created this library.
