    The ``oslo.privsep`` client can be called from a program using eventlet.
    If ``eventlet.monkey_patch``, some libraries will be patched, for example
    ``threading`` or ``os``. When the root daemon is forked from the client
    process, those libraries remain patched. Now, when the daemon is forked
    from the client process, those libraries and methods are restored to the
    original values. The goal is to prevent some timeouts when using eventlet
    threads (user threads); system threads are preemptive and the code does
    not need to care about the executor token.
