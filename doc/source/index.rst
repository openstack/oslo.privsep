 oslo.privsep
==============

oslo.privsep is an OpenStack library for privilege separation.

It helps applications perform actions which require more or less
privileges than they were started with in a safe, easy to code
and easy to use manner. For more information on why this is generally
a good idea please read over the `principle of least privilege`_ and
the `specification`_ which created this library.
